This is an example of a breeder site parser.

The idea is the following: 

- We search for open data, presented at the site, about animals born within a certain period of time, e.g. from 2021-12-01 to 2021-12-31.
- Get the IDs for all the animals found.
- Form the links from the IDs.
- Go to links and parse all info about each animal.
- Write it to the database.
